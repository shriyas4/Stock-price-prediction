Collection of Data and Data Preprocessing

I chose the dataset from Yahoo Finance, feel free to do the same if you need.

#import the required libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib as mp
import sklearn as sl
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

#import the file you downloaded
df = pd.read_csv('AAPL.csv')

#check if the file has been uploaded properly
print(df.head())

#find if there is any missing value in the data
if df.isnull().any().any():
    print('Yes, there are missing values')
else:
    print('No, there are no missing values')
    
#find if there are any duplicate values
if df.duplicated().any().any():
    print('Yes, there are duplicate values')
else:
    print('No, there are no duplicate values')
    
#find the categorical variables so that they can be encoded.
categorical_vars = df.dtypes[df.dtypes == 'object'].index
print(df.columns)

#change the values 
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=categorical_vars)
print(df.columns)

#The StandardScaler class in scikit-learn standardizes features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance. 
#The result is a transformed feature where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. 
#This is a common preprocessing step in machine learning to avoid any bias towards features with larger values.

scaler = StandardScaler()
numerical_vars = list(df.select_dtypes(include=['float64', 'int64']).columns)
df[numerical_vars] = scaler.fit_transform(df[numerical_vars])
print(numerical_vars)

# Define the number of components for PCA
n_components = 2

# Instantiate the PCA object with the number of components
pca = PCA(n_components=n_components)

# Apply PCA to the numerical features of the DataFrame
df_pca = pca.fit_transform(df[numerical_vars])
print(df_pca)

#This splits your DataFrame into X_train (the training features), X_test (the testing features), y_train (the training target), and y_test (the testing target) with a 80:20 ratio.

df['target'] = df['Close'].shift(-1)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(df.drop('target', axis=1), df['target'], test_size=0.2)

print(X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test)

#this is end of data preprocessing
