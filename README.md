# Stock-price-prediction

Project Goal: The goal is to develop a user-friendly interface for the ML model that allows investors to input their preferences and receive similar predictions and recommendations. 

Elaboration of the Goal: There are four main things one must notice while they are preparing the model. Firstly, the interface that will be developed must be easy to navigate and use. Secondly, there must be scope for the person to input their preferences in the interface. Thirdly, the output of the model must be easily readable in the interface. Finally, there must be a feedback mechanism in the interface. This feedback must be relayed back to the model.

Important formulae regarding Financial Accounting Foundations: 

1. Assets = Liability + Equity
2. Revenue - Expenses = Net Income
3. Return On Equity = Net Income/ Equity.
4. Return on Equity = profit margin * asset turnover * asset to equity 
5. Debt Ratio = total liabilities/ total asset
6. Operating cycle = Number of days between purchase and sale + Number of days from sale till cash collection
7. Number of day's sales in inventory = Inventory/ Average daily cost of sales
8. Average Collection period = Accounts recievable/ Average daily sales
9. PE Ratio = Price/ Earnings

Vanishing gradient problem: LSTM is designed to address the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur in deep learning models that use recurrent connections. The problem arises when the gradient signal becomes too small to be useful for learning, causing the model to converge slowly or not at all. LSTM uses gates to control the flow of information, which helps to prevent the gradient signal from vanishing or exploding.

Applications: LSTM is commonly used in a wide range of applications, including natural language processing, speech recognition, image captioning, and time series analysis.
