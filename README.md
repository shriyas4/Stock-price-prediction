# Stock-price-prediction

Project Goal: The goal is to develop a user-friendly interface for the ML model that allows investors to input their preferences and receive similar predictions and recommendations. 

Elaboration of the Goal: There are four main things one must notice while they are preparing the model. Firstly, the interface that will be developed must be easy to navigate and use. Secondly, there must be scope for the person to input their preferences in the interface. Thirdly, the output of the model must be easily readable in the interface. Finally, there must be a feedback mechanism in the interface. This feedback must be relayed back to the model.
